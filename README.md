# Logistic-Regression
This repository contains implementation of Logistic Regression algorithm for classifying DBPedia documnets using local as well as Parameter server implementation.<br/>

We have implemented Logistic Regression Classifier for classification of DBPedia documents into one of movies classes, in local
as well as parameter server implememtation, and analysed for its learning rate characteristics. Logistic Regression classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a huge number of parameters in a learning problem.
